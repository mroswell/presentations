 Developer Evangelists are bridges – they can talk and share information
 between multiple groups about a multitude of technologies. Internally 
they are a bridge between support, product management, engineering, and 
marketing teams. They are also a bridge between external developers and 
internal management and engineering. We are connectors in the broad 
sense of that word. </span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span></span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Broad goals for our team</span></p><p class="c0"><span>1) Brand awareness – we help drive awareness for our product(s) and establish our company as a leader in Technology</span></p><p class="c0"><span>2)
 Thought leaders in our own space - we each have an area of 
specialization and help to promote our product as a place where thought 
leaders work and that our opinion on a broad range of matters should be 
trusted</span></p><p class="c0"><span>3) Making developers successful on
 our product - we work with the product team and external developers to 
help give external developers a sense of delight and excitement in using
 our product. </span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">How are Evangelists perceived in the community</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Just
 as a sales person gains trust from their customers by delivering the 
software to them on time and with the capabilities they promised – 
developer evangelists have to be trusted by the community they are 
talking to. Their trust is based on technical knowledge, honest 
assessment of the capabilities of their software, and being able to 
relate to the workflow and ways in which developers think.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span></span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Major attributes that make a good evangelist</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>In
 order to be effective in their role they have to have some key 
attributes and engage in a broad array of activities. It is important to
 remember that no one evangelist will be excellent at all these skills 
or activities but they need to be competent in all the areas and still 
engage in all the activities.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>1)
 Technical skills in working with code and technology. Without this they
 can not talk credibly to external developers nor can they communicate 
effectively with internal engineering</span></p><p class="c0"><span>2) 
Ability to speak effectively in public – they have to be able to get on 
stage, in front of a class, in front of customers, in a booth and convey
 both the marketing and technical message of the product. They have to 
be able to do it in a way that gets the developers excited about using 
the product and clearly see the benefits.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>3)
 They need to be able to write effectively – they will need to write 
blog posts, respond to questions in forums, talk to users in IRC, write 
email to the engineering team, and send reports to management.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>4)
 They have to be generally curious about technology and enjoy teaching 
it to others – they have to have a desire to seek out new tech and learn
 it, but they also have to generally have a desire to teach it to others
 rather than just use it themselves all the time. They need to be able 
to read blogs, twitter, talk to developers at shows, and other media 
channels to keep up with trends in their field. They need to spend a 
certain amount of time reading and contributing to social forums.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What do Evangelists do</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>In
 order to be effective in their role an evangelist has to engage in a 
broad array of activities. Some may be specialists in one of these areas
 but that does not mean they don’t have to be at least competent in all 
of these areas. Note this list is not in priority order since all of 
these activities are essential to be a good developer evangelist:</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>1)
 They need to get in front of developers – speaking at shows, attending 
shows, working at hackathons, talking or teaching at meetups</span></p><p class="c0"><span>2)
 They need to be involved in some of the product management feedback, 
especially regarding roadmap issues so they can effectively communicate 
the product intention and direction to external developers</span></p><p class="c0"><span>3)
 They need to be able to spend time talking to product engineers so they
 can effectively understand how the technology is supposed to work and 
give feedback so the engineers can understand how developers will use 
their product.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>4) They need to spend time 
learning and using new technology, both in sample applications and real 
applications – this is the only way for them to be able to speak with 
authority both at shows and in written form</span></p><p class="c0"><span>5)
 They need to spend some time teaching external developers how to use 
the products. They should also take the feedback learned in those 
classes back to the engineering team</span></p><p class="c0"><span>6) They need to write blog content to help communicate their knowledge and interesting features for the platform.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span></span></p></body></html>
